# Rust's Power: Traits & Structs in Action

In Rust, *structs* and *traits* are essential building blocks. A **struct** is like a container that holds related data together. 
For example, in our earthquake monitoring system, we’ve got an `EarthquakeEvent` struct. 
It’s packed with info like `magnitude`, `location`, and `timestamp`, all bundled together in one neat package.

But data alone doesn’t get us far—we need ways to work with it. That’s where **traits** come into play. 
Traits let us define shared behavior across different types. 
So, we have an `EarthquakeDataSource` trait with a method like `fetch_earthquake_data`. 
This trait can then be implemented for our `EarthquakeEvent` struct, allowing it to fetch and process the earthquake data from different sources, whether it’s a real-time feed or some historical database.

By combining structs and traits, we’re keeping our data clean, our code reusable. And, because it's Rust, you get all the performance perks while making sure your system stays rock-solid.
