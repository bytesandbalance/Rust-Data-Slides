# OpenTelemetry in Rust

We’ll explore **OpenTelemetry**, an observability framework that collects telemetry data from applications. 
It focuses on three main types: **traces**, **logs**, and **metrics**.

1. **Traces** capture the journey of a request through your application, providing insights into service interactions.
2. **Logs** record detailed events, helping you understand what happened at specific times for better troubleshooting.
3. **Metrics** give you quantitative data about application performance, such as request counts and error rates.

In Rust, you can implement OpenTelemetry using its dedicated SDK, which allows you to easily instrument your code.
By adding spans for tracing, structured logging for logs, and metrics collection, you’ll gain a comprehensive view of your application’s behavior.

To visualize this data, we can integrate **Jaeger**, an open-source distributed tracing system. 
Jaeger helps you analyze traces and monitor performance, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.
