# Why Go Async?

Let’s talk about why using async in Rust, especially when working with something like our earthquake data. 
When you’re fetching data and computing stats, you want your application to stay responsive. 
With async, you avoid blocking the entire application while waiting for those network requests to finish.

By using `async`, you’re telling Rust, 'I’ll need a moment to get this data, but let’s not just sit here.
Then, with `.await`, you pause the function until the data arrives, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime. 
This makes your app more efficient and gives it that modern touch.

In a nutshell, adopting async helps keep your application snappy while handling multiple requests seamlessly. 
It’s a smart way to manage data fetching and improve performance.
