# Title Slide

Create a macro that simplifies plotting various types of charts.

# What are Macros?


Macros in Rust are a feature that allows you to write code that generates other code. They can significantly reduce repetitive patterns, making your code cleaner and more flexible. By using macros, you ensure consistency across your codebase, especially when performing similar operations multiple times.

# Objective of the Assignment

For this assignment, your goal is to implement the `plot_data!` macro. This macro will help you generate different types of charts with minimal code repetition. You’ll need to handle several parameters:

- A reference to a DataFrame.
- Columns for the x and y axes.
- The type of chart you want to create—such as line, bar, or scatter.
- The file name for saving the plot, along with the title and axis labels.

Feel free to consult the `plotters` crate documentation for details on chart types and customization options. As a challenge, try adding custom styles like colors and fonts to your plots.

# Implementing the Macro


Here’s a brief overview of the `plot_data!` macro implementation. You will use the `plotters` crate to handle the actual plotting. The macro will:

1. Set up the necessary crates and extract data from the DataFrame.
2. Configure the drawing area and chart based on the parameters provided.
3. Add the specified chart type.
4. Save the resulting plot to a file.

This macro simplifies the process of creating different charts, making it easier to generate plots with just a few lines of code. Implement this macro and test it with various chart types and data configurations.
