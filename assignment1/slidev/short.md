# Understanding Macros in Rust


**What are Macros?**  
Macros are a way to write code that writes other code, allowing you to define patterns and automate repetitive tasks. 
This enhances code flexibility and consistency.

**Why Use Macros?**  
With macros, you can simplify complex code, reduce boilerplate, and increase productivity. 
For example, instead of writing the same plotting logic for different charts, you can create a macro that generates it for you.

**Our Goal**:  
Weâ€™ll implement a macro called `plot_data!`, which allows you to create different types of charts from data, 
including line, bar, or scatter plots, all while specifying the data and chart details in one simple call.

**Challenge for You**:  
Try customizing your plots with different styles!
